    "We will be using these different portfolios as training data for our models. Depending on the ```ticker``` and ```client``` type, we will select a portfolio accordingly to train our model. For example, if AAPL is passed as the ticker, we will select the Technology sector and use that list to train our model. However, if ```client``` is specified, then we want to see how the given ticker performs in comparison to other stocks in that category. As a result, when client is passed we instead train on the respective portfolio: ```esg```, ```income``` or ```growth```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a Random Forest classifier to make a decision on our investment. The reason behind this choice is that we have three different outputs that we can choose from: ```buy```, ```sell```, or ```hold```. As a result, this becomes a classification problem, and we can employ the random forest to solve this problem. Based on my feature engineering and the respective interests of the investors in this task, I have carefully chosen features that can soundly predict the potential price movement. The random forest will use these features and a target variable to analyse the complex relationships that have led to price movements in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our features are:\n",
    "- Total ESG\n",
    "- Social Score\n",
    "- Governance Score\n",
    "- ESG percentile\n",
    "- Beta\n",
    "- Market Cap\n",
    "- Average 5 year Dividend Yield\n",
    "- Forward Price to Earnings Ratio\n",
    "- Price to Book Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target variable is ```buy```, ```sell```, or ```hold```. We devise this target based on the performance of a particular stock in the last 10 years compared to the S&P 500. These are the conditions: \n",
    "- If a stock outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 15% in the last 10 years, then we make the target ```buy```. \n",
    "- If a stock underperformed the S&P 500 by more than 10% in the last 10 years, then it is a ```sell```. \n",
    "- Otherwise, it is a ```hold```. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then devise our explanation based on the particular features that stand out in the dataset of features. We also scrap some stocks immediately when a client is given. These are the cases where we scrap a stock entirely before running our model. \n",
    "- For income: if the stock's dividend is less than the mean dividend, then it is a ```sell```.\n",
    "- For ESG: if the stock's ESG is below the 50th percentile for ESG score then it is a ```sell```. \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us tailor the portfolio for a respective client.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sectors in the S&P 500 (and, therefore, that cover the whole market) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy\n",
    "- Materials\n",
    "- Industrials\n",
    "- Consumer Cyclical\n",
    "- Consumer Defensive\n",
    "- Health Care\n",
    "- Financials\n",
    "- Technology\n",
    "- Communication Services\n",
    "- Utilities\n",
    "- Real Estate\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these sectors as training data for the models. Once we pass in a ticker to our invest function, we will find which sector it falls under and use stocks in that sector to train the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list of stocks below show the stocks that we will use to train our models for each of the aforementioned sectors, as well as the stocks we will use to train the specific client-focused portfolios. "
